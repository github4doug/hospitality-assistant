### User Stories
* __Story 1 High Alert__   <p> As a host, get notified by the Assistant when urgent voice or text msgs need immediate attention in order to respond quickly. The Assistant will make judgements based on data from voice msgs, text msgs, guest profile and guest history.
* __Story 2 Compliance__ <p> As a host, get notified when any communication is out of compliance and get information on current standards and what you can and should not say or write to a guest. The Assistant can be configured to alert any party interested in communication compliance violations.
* __Story 3 Listing Quality__  <p> As a host, ask the Assistant to review your listings and get suggestions that will improve the quality of each listing. The Assistant will rate the listing and make suggestions such as 'these photos could use more brightness and color' and 'you seem to be missing photos of your kitchen and master bathroom, including these will improve the quality of your listing'.
* __Story 4 Communication Review__ <p> As a host, ask the Assistant for a communication review and see a monthly summary of all your voice and text communication with ratings and how you compare to other hosts including suggestions on how to improve.
* __Story 5 Auto Response__ <p> As a host, configure templates for the Assistant to send automated text responses in order to maintain a high response rate for common questions and requests. The Assistant will detect a request for 'local restaurants' from a guest whose first language is Japanese and include a Japanese translation of the local information guide.
